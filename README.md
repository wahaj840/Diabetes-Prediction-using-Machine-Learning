# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project employs machine learning to predict diabetes onset using diagnostic measurements. Our approach integrates data pre-processing, model selection, training, and evaluation to develop a reliable predictive model. This README outlines the project structure, setup, and usage instructions.

# Project Overview
Diabetes is a significant global health issue, affecting millions annually. Early and accurate prediction is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database from Kaggle and applies several machine learning algorithms to predict the occurrence of diabetes among individuals.


# Models and Techniques
The following models and techniques were explored:

**Logistic Regression**

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

**Random Forest**

The logistic regression model provided the best performance with a mean accuracy of 78% and has been deployed for real-time predictions.

# Data Pre-processing
Data cleaning and preparation steps included:

**Handling missing values**

**Feature engineering and normalization**

**Data balancing techniques**

**Evaluation Metrics**

# Model Performance
Model performance was evaluated using:

**Accuracy**

**Precision**

**Recall**

**F1-score**

# Deployment
The **logistic regression model** was deployed in a web application using Flask, which allows users to input their diagnostic measurements and receive predictions in real time.

# Conclusion
The project successfully implements a machine-learning-based system to predict diabetes, demonstrating effective use of various data science methodologies and techniques.
